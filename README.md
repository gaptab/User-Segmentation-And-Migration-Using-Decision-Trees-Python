# User-Segmentation-And-Migration-Using-Decision-Trees-Python

**Data Creation**

5,000 users are simulated with age, income, credit score, loan history, and engagement data.
The target variable "migrated" (1 = moved to new app, 0 = did not move) is set at 2% migration rate.

**Decision Tree Model**

The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.
A Decision Tree Classifier is trained to predict which users are most likely to migrate.

**Model Evaluation**

Accuracy Score shows how well the model predicts migration.
Classification Report gives precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Feature Importance Analysis**

The most influential factors for migration (e.g., income, credit score, engagement level) are identified.
